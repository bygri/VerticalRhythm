# VerticalRhythm

Use vertical rhythm in Pages.app and anything else that doesn't have a grid built in.

Simple macOS app that displays as an overlay atop your other windows. It prints a repeating series of horizontal lines.
The distance between lines can be customised.

The app can be downloaded in a zipped archive at https://github.com/bygri/VerticalRhythm/releases/download/1.0.1/VerticalRhythm.zip.

The pre-Sierra version is at https://github.com/bygri/VerticalRhythm/releases/download/1.0.0/VerticalRhythm.zip

That's all.
