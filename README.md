# VerticalRhythm

Use vertical rhythm in Pages.app.

Simple OS X app that displays as an overlay atop your other windows. It prints a repeating series of horizontal lines.
The distance between lines can be customised.

The app can be downloaded in a zipped archive at https://github.com/bygri/VerticalRhythm/releases/download/1.0.0/VerticalRhythm.zip.

That's all.
